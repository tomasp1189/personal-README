## Disclaimer

I'm not a fan of describing myself ‚Äì I'd much rather you get to know me through spending time together or engaging in lengthy conversations (which, apparently, I just can't help myself from having ü§£). I trust the team more than myself to provide an accurate account of what it‚Äôs like to work and interact with me, which I guess says a lot about me already. But alas, I‚Äôve been asked to provide this readme myself, so here goes.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="/img/me.jpeg" alt="Me" width="300px">

Born in Argentina and raised in Uruguay, I've never really felt at home anywhere but have always had a knack for adapting quickly. Currently, I live in Alicante, Spain.

Choosing one thing I love to do above others is tough. Maybe it's my ADHD, or perhaps I'm just really curious. Let's just say that I adore learning and trying new things.

Things I've tried and stuck with:

- Singing and Playing guitar
- Hiking
- Surfskating
- Fasting
- Ice (or very cold) baths
- Yoga
- HIIT
- Waking up at 5am (even on weekends)

I'm a father of two beautiful kids (you'll likely see them pop up during a meeting). Being fully responsible for them (their mom lives in another country) means my availability can sometimes be hectic, but I'm flexible and do my best to make it work üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶.

If I had to choose my best quality, it would be a toss-up between perseverance and a high-spirited attitude.
### Built With

- Sunny disposition
- Endless curiosity
- Northern European XL Body
- Latin American intensity
- Fabulous hair
- Incessant self-doubt
- Unnatainable self-expactations
- ADHD (Batteries included)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To start a conversation, just hit me up ‚Äì or don't. I'll likely start one anyway. I'm always up for a chat, and the subject isn't really important as long as we get to talk.

### Prerequisites

None. Ask anybody. I'm probably the easiest person to strike up a conversation with in the company.

### Installation

Choose any messaging or video-call app from the following list, and you'll be ready to get started:

- Discord
- Meet
- Whatsapp
- Zoom

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

### FE Tech Lead

I guess I've accumulated enough experience not only to be proficient in coding but also to effectively guide team members in our Front End endeavors.

- I have an optimistic approach to leadership, always assuming the best of everyone until proven otherwise.
- As someone who dislikes being micro-managed, I avoid doing it to others.
- Recognizing that life happens in phases, I don't expect you to be at your peak performance 100% of the time.
- My only expectation is that you give your best effort.
- Pair Programming is my favourite collaboration tool.
- I strive to meet with my team members individually at least once a week for a sync, and I'm open to pairing sessions as often as needed, provided it doesn't hinder my ability to fulfill my responsibilities to other team members and the company.
- My goal is for you to enjoy your job, and I'll do my best to ensure you're satisfied with the work you're doing. That being said, I have blind spots, so I encourage you to make an effort to communicate your needs. I'll do my utmost to meet those needs, or at the very least, manage expectations and find a compromise that works for both of us.
- Decisions are made collectively as a team, and we need to trust each person's expertise in their respective area ‚Äì I'm not a dictator.
- As the team leader, I've got your back. We'll celebrate our successes together, and if things go south, I'll step up and handle the consequences.

### WEB3 Research and Development

I've been fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to lead the Web3 efforts within the company. While I'm not an expert (yet!), I'm dedicating most of my time to researching, learning, and coding in this area. Rest assured, I'll work hard to reach a high level of expertise in the process.

### Colleague

I'm truly passionate about my work, and I love seeing others just as fired up about what they do. If you ever need someone to bounce ideas off of, know that I'm always up for being your partner in crime and creative collaborator.
