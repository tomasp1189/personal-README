## Disclaimer

I don't enjoy describing myself, I would much rather you get to know me by spending time together or through long conversations (which I've been told I basically can't help myself from having ü§£). I would trust the team more than myself to give an accurate account of what it‚Äôs like to work and interact with me which I guess already says a lot about me. But alas, I‚Äôve been requested to provide the readme myself so here it is.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="/img/me.jpeg" alt="Me" width="300px">

I was born in Argentina and raised in Uruguay. Never really felt at home anywhere but I've always had a knack to quickly adapt. I currently live in Alicante, Spain.

I'd be hard pressed to choose one thing I love to do above others. Maybe its my ADHD, maybe I'm just very curious. Let's just say that I really love learning and trying new things.

Things I've tried and kept doing:

- Singing and Playing guitar
- Hiking
- Surfskating
- Fasting
- Ice (or very cold) baths
- Yoga
- HIIT

I'm a father of two beautiful kids (you'll eventually see them pop in the middle of a meeting). I'm fully responsible for them (their mom lives in another country) so you'll notice that sometimes my availability is a bit hectic but I'm very flexible and I try my best to make it work üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶.

### Built With

- Sunny disposition
- Endless curiosity
- Northern European XL Body
- Latin American intensity
- Low self-esteem
- Fabulous hair
- ADHD (Batteries included)
