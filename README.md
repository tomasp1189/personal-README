## Disclaimer

I don't enjoy describing myself, I would much rather you get to know me by spending time together or through long conversations (which I've been told I basically can't help myself from having ü§£). I would trust the team more than myself to give an accurate account of what it‚Äôs like to work and interact with me which I guess already says a lot about me. But alas, I‚Äôve been requested to provide the readme myself so here it is.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="/img/me.jpeg" alt="Me" width="300px">

I was born in Argentina and raised in Uruguay. Never really felt at home anywhere but I've always had a knack to quickly adapt. I currently live in Alicante, Spain.

I'd be hard pressed to choose one thing I love to do above others. Maybe its my ADHD, maybe I'm just very curious. Let's just say that I really love learning and trying new things.

Things I've tried and kept doing:

- Singing and Playing guitar
- Hiking
- Surfskating
- Fasting
- Ice (or very cold) baths
- Yoga
- HIIT
- Waking up at 5am (even on weekends)

I'm a father of two beautiful kids (you'll eventually see them pop in the middle of a meeting). I'm fully responsible for them (their mom lives in another country) so you'll notice that sometimes my availability is a bit hectic but I'm very flexible and I try my best to make it work üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶.

### Built With

- Sunny disposition
- Endless curiosity
- Northern European XL Body
- Latin American intensity
- Fabulous hair
- Incessant self-doubt
- Unnatainable self-expactations
- ADHD (Batteries included)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

### FE Tech Lead

I guess I've accumulated enough experience not only to be proficient in coding but also to effectively guide team members in our Front End endeavors.

- I have an optimistic approach to leadership, always assuming the best of everyone until proven otherwise.
- As someone who dislikes being micro-managed, I avoid doing it to others.
- Recognizing that life happens in phases, I don't expect you to be at your peak performance 100% of the time.
- My only expectation is that you give your best effort.
- I strive to meet with my team members individually at least once a week for a sync, and I'm open to pairing sessions as often as needed, provided it doesn't hinder my ability to fulfill my responsibilities to other team members and the company.
- My goal is for you to enjoy your job, and I'll do my best to ensure you're satisfied with the work you're doing. That being said, I have blind spots, so I encourage you to make an effort to communicate your needs. I'll do my utmost to meet those needs, or at the very least, manage expectations and find a compromise that works for both of us.
- I am not a dictator; decisions will be made collectively as a team, and we need to trust each person's expertise in their respective area.
- As the team leader, I've got your back. We'll celebrate our successes together, and if things go south, I'll step up and handle the consequences.

### WEB3 Research and Development

Life has blessed me once again, as it often does, by giving me the opportunity to lead the Web3 efforts within the company. While this doesn't make me an expert, it does mean that I'm currently dedicating most of my time to researching and coding in this area. Rest assured, I'll strive to achieve a high level of expertise in the process.

Life has blessed me, as I often feel it does, and i've been given the opportunity to lead the Web3 efforts in the company. By no means does this make me an expert it simply means this is what I currently spend most time investigating and coding and I will strive to reach a level of expertise.

### Colleague

I'm super passionate about my work and love seeing others fired up about theirs too. If you ever need to bounce ideas off someone, just know I'm always up for being your partner in crime.

By no means do I believe I'm an expert in any of the areas described above and I pride myself on being big on self-improvement so I'm all about feedback. If you have any, good or bad, it's always welcome. Ideally it will come in the form of a video-call but direct messages are also valid.
