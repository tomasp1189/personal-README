## Disclaimer

I don't enjoy describing myself, I would much rather you get to know me by spending time together or through long conversations (which I've been told I basically can't help myself from having ü§£). I would trust the team more than myself to give an accurate account of what it‚Äôs like to work and interact with me which I guess already says a lot about me. But alas, I‚Äôve been requested to provide the readme myself so here it is.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="/img/me.jpeg" alt="Me" width="300px">

I was born in Argentina and raised in Uruguay. Never really felt at home anywhere but I've always had a knack to quickly adapt. I currently live in Alicante, Spain.

I'd be hard pressed to choose one thing I love to do above others. Maybe its my ADHD, maybe I'm just very curious. Let's just say that I really love learning and trying new things.

Things I've tried and kept doing:

- Singing and Playing guitar
- Hiking
- Surfskating
- Fasting
- Ice (or very cold) baths
- Yoga
- HIIT
- Waking up at 5am (even on weekends)

I'm a father of two beautiful kids (you'll eventually see them pop in the middle of a meeting). I'm fully responsible for them (their mom lives in another country) so you'll notice that sometimes my availability is a bit hectic but I'm very flexible and I try my best to make it work üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶.

### Built With

- Sunny disposition
- Endless curiosity
- Northern European XL Body
- Latin American intensity
- Fabulous hair
- Incessant self-doubt
- Unnatainable self-expactations
- ADHD (Batteries included)

## Getting Started

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

### FE Tech Lead

I guess I've accumulated enough experience not only to be proficient in coding but also to effectively guide team members in our Front End endeavors.

- I have an optimistic approach to leadership, always assuming the best of everyone until proven otherwise.
- As someone who dislikes being micro-managed, I avoid doing it to others.
- Recognizing that life happens in phases, I don't expect you to be at your peak performance 100% of the time.
- My only expectation is that you give your best effort.
- I strive to meet with my team members individually at least once a week for a sync, and I'm open to pairing sessions as often as needed, provided it doesn't hinder my ability to fulfill my responsibilities to other team members and the company.
- I want you to enjoy your job as much as I do, this means that 

### WEB3 Research and Development

Life has blessed me, as I often feel it does, and i've been given the opportunity to lead the Web3 efforts in the company but by no means does this mean I'm the expert. This is what I currently spend most time coding.

### Colleague

I'm passionate about my work and enjoy seeing others passionate about theirs. If you need to bounce ideas off someone you'll find me to be a partner in crime.
